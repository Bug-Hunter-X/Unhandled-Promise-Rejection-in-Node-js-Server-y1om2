# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: unhandled promise rejections within asynchronous request handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) might throw an error, but the error handling is inadequate.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling using a try...catch block.

## Problem

The original code lacks robust error handling within the asynchronous operation.  If `somePromiseThatMightReject` rejects, the rejection isn't properly caught within the request handler's `catch` block. This leads to unhandled promise rejections, causing the server to crash or behave unexpectedly.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully handling potential errors in asynchronous operations.  The improved error handling ensures that exceptions are caught and handled gracefully, preventing unexpected server behavior.
